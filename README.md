# Coding Problem 4 - Keno Game

## Game Description
Keno is a lottery-like gambling game where 20 numbers are randomly selected out of numbers ranging from 1 to 80. 
Players wager on how many numbers they can match out of the numbers that are randomly generated.
## Directions
Complete the given template which provides the <b>Test4Driver.cpp</b> file and the <b>P4.cpp</b> source files. You will need to complete the implementation of any function that is marked as <b>"implementation of X function goes here"</b> in the comments of <b>P4.cpp</b> source file. <b>Note: Make no changes to any other code.</b>

### Program Specification
The completed program will prompt the user for 10 numbers they will enter to try and match the 20 random 
Keno numbers (1-80 inclusive) generated by the computer. The program validates the numbers that the user enters. 
It will check that they are not out of range, of an invalid data type, and that they are not duplicate numbers to 
those previously entered. The program will allow the user to correct their mistake. 
Once the 10 numbers have been picked, the program will generate 20 random numbers in the range of 1-80 
without any duplicate numbers. The program will report the winning Keno numbers generated, 
the player’s picks, and which numbers they matched. The program tells the player what they have won. 
<ul>
